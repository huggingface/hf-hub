# hf-hub

Async Rust client library for the [Hugging Face Hub API](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/api). This is the Rust equivalent of the Python [`huggingface_hub`](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) library.

The primary entry point is the `HFClient` struct, which wraps an `Arc<HFClientInner>` for cheap cloning. All methods are async and use `reqwest` as the HTTP client. Paginated endpoints return `impl Stream<Item = Result<T>>` via `futures::stream::try_unfold`. Methods take parameters via [`bon`](https://docs.rs/bon) per-method builders finished with `.send().await` (mirroring reqwest / aws-sdk / octocrab style).

Key capabilities:

- Repository info, listing, creation, deletion, and settings updates
- File upload, download, listing, and deletion
- Commit creation, commit history, diffs between revisions
- Branch and tag management
- User and organization info
- Xet high-performance transfers

## Code Standards

These rules apply to ALL code written or modified in this repo:

### Style

- NO trivial comments — do not add comments that restate what the code does
- Descriptive variable and function names
- No wildcard imports (e.g., `use foo::*`), except `pub use` re-exports in `lib.rs`
- All imports are at the top of the file or top of module
- Latest stable Rust features are allowed

### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` with explicit error handling — never panic
- Define custom error types using `thiserror` for domain-specific errors
- Provide helpful, actionable error messages

### Performance

- Be mindful of allocations in hot paths
- Prefer structured logging (tracing/log macros with fields, not string formatting)

### Dependencies

- Add all dependencies to `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) or `hf-hub/Cargo.toml` (crate-level)
- Prefer well-maintained crates from crates.io
- Shared dependencies belong in the workspace `[dependencies]` table, not per-crate

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

- Place in the same file using `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- Run: `cargo test -p hf-hub`

#### Integration Tests

- Located in the `integration-tests` workspace crate, under `integration-tests/tests/` (`integration_test.rs`, `blocking_test.rs`, `bucket_sync_test.rs`, `bucket_xet_transfer_test.rs`, `cache_test.rs`, `download_test.rs`, `xet_transfer_test.rs`). Shared helpers live in `integration-tests/src/test_utils.rs`.
- Require a valid `HF_TOKEN` environment variable and internet access
- Tests skip gracefully when `HF_TOKEN` is not set (no failures)
- Run read-only tests: `HF_TOKEN=HF_xxx cargo test -p integration-tests`
- Write operation tests (create/delete repos, upload files) require `HF_TEST_WRITE=1`
- Run all tests including writes: `HF_TOKEN=HF_xxx HF_TEST_WRITE=1 cargo test -p integration-tests`

### Formatting and Linting

- Format: `cargo +nightly fmt`
- Lint: `cargo clippy -p hf-hub --all-features -- -D warnings`
- ALWAYS run both after making changes — do not skip this step

### Minimal Changes

- Verify that every change is minimal and necessary — do not include unrelated modifications

### Method builders (bon)

All public methods on `HFClient`, `HFRepository`, `HFSpace`, and `HFBucket` use `bon`'s
per-method `#[builder(finish_fn = send)]` pattern. Do NOT introduce `*Params` wrapper structs —
parameters live directly on the method. Every method (including parameterless ones like `info`,
`exists`, `pause`, `whoami`) is finished with `.send()` for uniformity.

```rust
use bon::bon;

#[bon]
impl HFRepository {
    #[builder(finish_fn = send)]
    pub async fn my_method(
        &self,
        #[builder(into)] name: String,
        revision: Option<String>,
    ) -> HFResult<MyOutput> { ... }
}
```

Translation rules from `typed-builder` attributes (now removed):

| typed-builder | bon (as method param) |
|---|---|
| `#[builder(setter(into))] x: String` | `#[builder(into)] x: String` |
| `#[builder(default, setter(strip_option))] x: Option<T>` | `x: Option<T>` (implicit) |
| `#[builder(default, setter(into, strip_option))] x: Option<String>` | `#[builder(into)] x: Option<String>` |
| `#[builder(default)] x: bool` | `#[builder(default)] x: bool` |
| `#[builder(default = expr)] x: T` | `#[builder(default = expr)] x: T` |
| required field, no attribute | `x: T` |

bon also generates a `maybe_<field>(opt)` setter alongside each `Option<T>` parameter — use it
when forwarding an existing `Option<T>` value (e.g. inside a sync mirror, or when porting a
helper that already has the field as an `Option<T>` local).

#### Mandatory blocking counterpart

Every async method MUST have a manually-written blocking counterpart on the corresponding
`*Sync` struct under `#[cfg(feature = "blocking")]`. Mirror the same `#[builder]` parameter list
verbatim. The body calls the inner async builder and blocks on the runtime:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "blocking")]
#[bon]
impl crate::blocking::HFRepositorySync {
    #[builder(finish_fn = send)]
    pub fn my_method(
        &self,
        #[builder(into)] name: String,
        revision: Option<String>,
    ) -> HFResult<MyOutput> {
        self.runtime.block_on(
            self.inner
                .my_method()
                .name(name)
                .maybe_revision(revision)
                .send(),
        )
    }
}
```

For stream-returning methods, the sync counterpart collects into `Vec<T>`: pin the stream and
drain with `while let Some` (see existing examples in `repository/listing.rs` and
`repository/mod.rs`). On `HFSpaceSync`, the runtime is reached via `&self.repo_sync.runtime`
because the struct has no direct `runtime` field. Do NOT reintroduce the legacy `sync_api!` /
`sync_api_stream!` / `sync_api_async_stream!` macros — they were removed deliberately when the
crate moved to bon.

When parameters need a backing struct for internal helpers (e.g. `DownloadFileParams` is
plumbed through several private functions in `repository/download.rs`), keep that struct
**private** to the module with no `#[derive(TypedBuilder)]` and have the bon method assemble it.
Never expose it publicly.

## Project Layout

> **Agents MUST update this section when adding new crates or large modules.**

Types and API methods live together per component. Each component is either a single file (for smaller components) or a folder (when the impl block needs splitting). The user-facing types are re-exported flat at `hf_hub::<component>::…` (e.g. `hf_hub::repository::CommitOperation`); no `hf_hub::types` module exists.

Submodules inside a component folder are declared `pub mod` rather than `mod`. This makes the bon-generated builder structs (e.g. `HFRepositoryListCommitsBuilder` from `repository/commits.rs`) reachable through their canonical path so rustdoc renders them. The user-visible types still appear flat at `hf_hub::<component>::…` via the existing `pub use` re-exports — `pub mod` just adds the per-submodule path as an additional location where rustdoc documents items.

## Feature Development

Before writing any code:

1. **Branch:** Confirm you are on a feature branch, not `main`. If on `main`, create a branch named `<username>/<short-description>`.
2. **Plan:** Write an implementation plan that includes testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, manual verification steps). Add this plan as a comment on the PR.

When changing public interfaces or adding user-facing capabilities:

- ALWAYS update the relevant examples in `examples/` and any affected README snippets so they match the current public API.
- ALWAYS add at least one example for new functionality unless an existing example already demonstrates that exact workflow clearly.
- Prefer examples that show the intended high-level interface, not just the lowest-level parameter structs, especially for new ergonomic APIs like repo handles.

## Code Review

When reviewing a pull request, follow these rules:

### Tone

- Collegiate and constructive — write as a peer, not an authority
- Use phrases like "consider...", "what do you think about...", "we might want to..."
- Acknowledge good decisions and clean patterns, not just problems
- When unsure, ask a clarifying question instead of assuming something is wrong

### What to Review

- **Correctness** — logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one errors
- **Readability** — naming consistency, code clarity, helpful error messages
- **Maintainability** — temporary workarounds tracked, types in the right crate, clean abstractions
- **Testability** — missing tests for new endpoints/logic, weakened assertions, coverage gaps
- **Performance** — unnecessary allocations in hot paths, unbounded response sizes, missing concurrency limits
- **Security** — auth checks on new routes, input validation, error message information leakage

### How to Structure Feedback

- Post a summary comment on the PR: overview of the changes, key observations, cross-cutting concerns
- Add inline comments at specific diff locations for targeted feedback
- Prefix minor style suggestions with `nit:` — these are optional and the author may skip them
- Do NOT prefix substantive feedback (public API changes, correctness issues, missing tests) — these require attention
