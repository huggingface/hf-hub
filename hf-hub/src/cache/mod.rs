//! Inspect the local Hugging Face cache.
//!
//! [`HFClient::scan_cache`] walks the cache directory and produces an
//! [`HFCacheInfo`] tree: cached repositories, their revisions, and the
//! individual files in each revision.
//!
//! On disk, downloads are content-addressed — files in
//! `<cache>/<repo_folder>/snapshots/<commit>/<filename>` are pointers (symlinks
//! on Unix, copies on Windows) to immutable blobs in
//! `<cache>/<repo_folder>/blobs/<etag>`. Multiple revisions of the same repo
//! often share the same blob, which is why repo-level sizes are deduplicated
//! while revision-level sizes are not — see [`CachedRepoInfo::size_on_disk`]
//! and [`CachedRevisionInfo::size_on_disk`].
