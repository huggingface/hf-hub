//! Progress reporting for upload and download operations.
//!
//! Implement [`ProgressHandler`] and pass the handler to the `.progress(...)` setter on any
//! method builder that supports progress reporting (upload, download, snapshot download,
//! `create_commit`, bucket sync, etc.). Each `.progress(...)` argument is converted to [`Progress`]
//! via [`Into`]: an owned handler, an `Arc<H>`, [`Progress::new`], or a [`Progress`] value. When no handler is set,
//! the library emits nothing — there is no runtime cost.
//!
//! # Event model
//!
//! Every operation that supports progress emits a stream of [`ProgressEvent`]s
//! framed by a `Start` event and a `Complete` event. If the operation returns
//! an error, `Complete` is **not** emitted — consumers should rely on the
//! returned `Result` for operation success, not on observing `Complete`.
//!
//! Upload and download events are distinct enums ([`UploadEvent`] and
//! [`DownloadEvent`]) wrapped in a [`ProgressEvent`] discriminator. An
//! individual operation only emits one variant family (e.g. `create_commit`
//! only emits `Upload(*)`, `snapshot_download` only emits `Download(*)`).
//!
//! ## Upload event sequence
//!
//! ```text
//!   Start ──┐
//!           │ (silent preflight: preupload API, LFS classification)
//!   Progress ── Progress ── … ── Progress
//!           │ (active upload — poll loop fires ~every 100ms)
//!   Committing
//!           │ (silent: commit API round-trip)
//!   Complete
//! ```
//!
//! ## Download event sequence
//!
//! ```text
//!   Start ──┐
//!           │ (HEAD fan-out may precede this for snapshot downloads)
//!   Progress ── Progress ── … ── AggregateProgress ── Progress ── …
//!           │ (Progress = per-file deltas; AggregateProgress = xet batch
//!           │  totals. Either or both, interleaved.)
//!   Complete
//! ```
//!
//! # Implementing a handler

//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Thread safety and performance contract
//!
//! [`ProgressHandler`] requires `Send + Sync` because the library may invoke
//! `on_progress` from arbitrary tokio tasks, including background poll loops
//! running on ~100ms tick intervals during active transfers. Implementations
//! should:
//!
//! - **Never block.** Blocking `on_progress` blocks the emitting task, which for upload/download poll loops means
//!   delaying subsequent progress observations. For network streams the library calls `on_progress` on the stream-read
//!   path itself — slow handlers directly slow the transfer.
//! - **Not panic.** Panics propagate through the tokio runtime and can abort the operation.
//! - **Be idempotent / tolerant of redundant state.** The library guarantees event *ordering* but not *deduplication*;
//!   e.g. a file may receive multiple `FileStatus::Complete` events across `Progress` and a final cleanup emit in edge
//!   cases. Consumers that track completion should use a set keyed by filename to ignore repeats.
